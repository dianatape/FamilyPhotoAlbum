# Contributing to the Family Photo Album

Welcome, family member! Here's how you can contribute to our shared album:

## Adding a New "Photo"

1. Create a new branch from `main` with a descriptive name (e.g., `add-summer-picnic-2023`).
2. In the appropriate folder, create a new Markdown file named after your photo (e.g., `summer-picnic-2023.md`).
3. Use this template for your file:

```markdown
# [Title of Photo]

![Description](https://placeholder.com/your-photo-name)

**Date:** [Date of Photo]
**Location:** [Where it was taken]

**Description:** 
[Write a few sentences about this photo]

**People:** 
- [Person 1]
- [Person 2]
- ...

**Tags:** #[tag1], #[tag2], ...
```

4. Commit your changes with a clear message.
5. Push your branch and create a Pull Request.

## Updating an Existing "Photo"

1. Create a new branch from `main`.
2. Make your changes to the existing Markdown file.
3. Commit, push, and create a Pull Request with your updates.

## Resolving Conflicts

If your Pull Request has conflicts:
1. Pull the latest changes from the `main` branch into your branch.
2. Resolve any conflicts in the files.
3. Commit the resolved changes and update your Pull Request.

Remember, this is a collaborative project. Be kind, be constructive, and happy memory sharing!
