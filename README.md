# Welcome to the Family Photo Album Project

This project is a collaborative effort to create a digital family photo album using Git and GitHub. It's designed to teach version control and collaboration concepts through a familiar, family-oriented scenario.

## How It Works

1. Each participant is a "family member" contributing to our shared album.
2. "Photos" are represented by Markdown files containing descriptions and placeholder image links.
3. We use GitHub's features (branches, pull requests, issues) to manage our contributions.

## Getting Started

1. Fork this repository to create your own copy.
2. Clone your fork to your local machine.
3. Follow the lessons in the Issues tab to start contributing!
